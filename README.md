in this program, the user has a display of buttons labled with different foods. When the user clicks on the button, 10 gifs of the food they clicked on are displayed on the screen with the ratings of each gif. The gifs are displayed as a still image and get animated when clicked on and turn into still when clicked again. 
\ 
In the search bar at the top of the screen, the user can search for which ever gif they would like to see displayed, and a button of their seach will display within the buttons and the button will have the exact same functionalities as the ones that are already displayed.
